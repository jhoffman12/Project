    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>What is my webste about?</h2>
    <p>
        My website will focus on the various food cuisines in the city of Manhattan Beach California. It will be  a website that tourists can come to find the perfect restaurants that fit all of their needs.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is this website important?</h2>
    <p>Given that Manhattan Beach is a hotspot for tourists in the summer months, this type of site would inform tourists of all the possble restaurants. This also helps the local businesses attract more customers by informing them about their company.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is my target audience?</h2>
    <p>I am mainly choosing to target tourists, however more specifically families looking to fill their vacation with enjoyable experiences.</p>
    <h2>What content do I plan to include?</h2>
    <p>As of right now, I am still in the brainstorming phase of how to format this website. Ideally, there would be a directory of all of the restaurants in the area which would link to their section on the website. From there, if the restaurant has a personal website we would attach that as well. I would also like to have a column based on reviews by locals and describe the experience you could expect at certain restaurants. I would also like to have a section that shows fan favorites from the menu and even recommend places in town to go beforehand for cocktails or after for dessert. A majority of these restaunts will be based in Mnahhattan Beach however there may be some places listed in other towns near by.</p>
